=== Upgrading to 5.x

With Pingbeat 5.x and higher, the fields have changed names and structure.

You can upgrade your existing indices to the new format (after loading
the new http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-templates.html[index
template]) with a combination of an
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ingest.html[Ingest
Pipeline] and the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-reindex.html[Reindex API].

First, add a Ingest Pipeline to Elasticsearch as defined below:

[source, json]
-------------------------------------
PUT _ingest/pipeline/pingbeat_upgrade
{
  "description": "upgrade pingbeat fields",
  "processors": [
    {
      "rename": {
        "field": "tag",
        "target_field": "target.tags",
        "ignore_missing": true
      }
    },
    {
      "rename": {
        "field": "desc",
        "target_field": "target.desc",
        "ignore_missing": true
      }
    },
    {
      "rename": {
        "field": "target_name",
        "target_field": "target.name",
        "ignore_missing": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
-------------------------------------

Now, for each index you want to upgrade, use the Reindex API as
follows:

[source, json]
-------------------------------------
POST _reindex?wait_for_completion=false
{
  "source": {
    "index": "pingbeat-old"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "pingbeat-new"
  }
}
-------------------------------------

Adjust the new and old index names as necessary.  The
`wait_for_completion=false` parameter is optional, but allows you to
start multiple reindex operations in parallel.
